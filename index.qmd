## Introduction

This is a ridiculous piece I am writing in Arvind's class.He is making things difficult for me.

## My first piece of R code

```{r}
#| label: setup
 library(tidyverse)
 library(ggformula)
 library(babynames)
 library(mosaic)
 library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
babynames%>% filter(name== "Raina")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name== "Aditi") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year)
```

```         
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Raina" | name == "Rayna")

```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Raina" | name == "Rayna") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year, color = ~name)
```

## Dataet on MathAnxiety

```{r}
MathAnxiety <- read.csv("MathAnxiety.csv", sep = ";")
MathAnxiety
```

```{r}
MathAnxiety %>%
  group_by(Age,Gender,Grade) %>%
  summarize(AMAS = mean(AMAS), count = n())
```

```{r}
MathAnxiety %>%
  group_by(Age,Gender,Grade) %>%
  summarize(RCMAS = mean(RCMAS), count = n())
```

```{r}
MathAnxiety %>%
  group_by(Age,Gender,Grade) %>%
  summarize(Arith = mean(Arith), count = n())
```

```{r}
MathAnxiety %>%
  group_by(Age,Grade) %>%
  summarize(AMAS = mean(AMAS), count = n())
```

```{r}
MathAnxiety %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_AMAS=mean(AMAS),
    avg_RCMAS=mean(RCMAS),
    avg_Arith=mean(Arith),
    count=n()
  )
```
